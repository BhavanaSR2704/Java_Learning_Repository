-->A data type tells Java what type of value a variable can store.

Java data types are divided into 2 types:
--->Primitive Data Types:
  These store simple values and are builtin like:
  *int
  *float
  *double
  *char
--->Non-Primitive Data Types:
  These store complex values and are created by the user like:  
  *String
  *Arrays
  *Classes
  *Objects
